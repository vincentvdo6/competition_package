Validation Set Statistics
========================
Shape: (1,444,000, 37) = 1,444 sequences x 1000 steps each
Columns: seq_ix, step_in_seq, need_prediction, p0-p11, v0-v11, dp0-dp3, dv0-dv3, t0, t1

Feature Groups:
- p0-p5: Bid prices (6 levels)
- p6-p11: Ask prices (6 levels)
- v0-v5: Bid volumes (6 levels)
- v6-v11: Ask volumes (6 levels)
- dp0-dp3: Trade price changes (4 features)
- dv0-dv3: Trade volume changes (4 features)

ALL features are pre-scaled to approximately [-5.2, 5.2] (NOT raw prices/volumes).

=== Feature Ranges (key features) ===
p0:  [0.83, 5.20], mean=1.87, std=0.66  (best bid price)
p6:  [0.83, 5.20], mean=1.94, std=0.64  (best ask price)
v0:  [-3.71, 4.00], mean=0.69, std=0.76  (best bid volume)
v6:  [-5.20, 5.20], mean=0.31, std=0.76  (best ask volume)
dp0: [-5.20, 5.20], mean=-0.02, std=1.55  (trade price change, highest variance)
dv0: [-5.20, 4.04], mean=-0.27, std=1.06  (trade volume change)

=== Target Statistics ===
t0: mean=-0.21, std=1.26, range=[-44.0, 39.3]
t1: mean=-0.06, std=1.98, range=[-36.0, 39.0]

t1 has ~1.6x the std of t0 and much heavier tails.
Targets are moderately correlated: corr(t0,t1) ~= 0.44-0.51

=== Target Autocorrelation (within sequences) ===
t0: lag-1 = 0.715 (moderate)
t1: lag-1 = 0.976 (very high — t1 is highly persistent)

=== Train-Validation Distribution Shift ===
Material shift in price features (KS stat up to 0.33 for p6, p0, p7, p1, p3).
Volume and trade features show less shift.
This shift explains why models that overfit to training patterns fail on validation/test.

=== Per-Sequence Variation ===
Price features have HIGH per-sequence variation (CoV 0.40-0.61).
Volume features have moderate variation (CoV 0.07-0.37).
Per-sequence STDs vary hugely (e.g., dp0: 0.60-2.74, 4x variation).
Despite this variation, per-sequence normalization (RevIN) HURTS — GRU handles it internally.
