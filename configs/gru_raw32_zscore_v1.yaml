# Raw 32 features WITH z-score normalization (ablation: isolate features vs normalization)
# Base: gru_derived_tightwd_v2 with ONE change: derived_features: false
# Tests whether raw 32 is better/worse than derived 42 when normalization is kept constant
# Kill test: 3 seeds, compare to tightwd_v2 val ~0.266
