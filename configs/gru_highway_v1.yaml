# PARITY AUDIT: Match official baseline architecture as closely as possible
# Official baseline: plain 3-layer GRU h=64, raw 32 features, no normalization,
# linear output, scores 0.2761 LB with val=0.2595 (+0.017 POSITIVE gap)
#
# Our baseline_match (same h=64 3L but with input_proj+LayerNorm+MLP+derived+zscore):
# val=0.2738, LB=0.2394 (-0.034 gap). CATASTROPHIC.
#
# Hypothesis: our pipeline's extra complexity CAUSES overfitting.
# The baseline's simplicity IS the regularization.
#
# This config strips EVERYTHING:
# - vanilla: true (no input projection, no LayerNorm, no input dropout)
# - output_type: linear (no MLP output head)
# - raw 32 features (no derived)
# - no z-score normalization
# - dropout: 0 (official baseline has no dropout)
# - MSE loss (simplest possible)
#
# Kill test: 3 seeds. SUCCESS = val-LB gap closer to 0 (or positive).
# Val might be LOWER than tightwd_v2 — that's OK if generalization improves.
